description: Inherit an unfamiliar codebase and refactor it incrementally. Map first, then improve without breaking behavior.
argument-hint: [area to refactor or goal]
---
Act as a senior engineer who just inherited a large, unfamiliar codebase. Map the
architecture and data flow before changing anything.

Goal: $ARGUMENTS

Then identify: structural problems, duplicated logic, performance bottlenecks, dead
code, and risky patterns. Propose a prioritized refactor plan, highest impact and
lowest risk first, and explain the reasoning.

Then refactor incrementally: keep behavior intact and verify with tests after each
step. No big-bang rewrite. If you don't have a test protecting a change, write one
first.
